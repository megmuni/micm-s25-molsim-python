But we can also use other libraries in Python, like numpy, scipy, and ML libraries, to enrich our analysis.\n","\n","MD trajectories contain a LOT of data. Consider that these simulations save data of hundreds or thousands of atoms at thousands of time points. This results in a dataset with many **dimensions** (a.k.a features or variables). We can often make analysis a lot easier for ourselves by reducing the number of dimensions that we work with. This process is called **dimensionality reduction**. But how do we decide which features or variables to keep?\n","\n","There are a lot of reduction methods. Today, we'll experiment with one called PCA, or principal component analysis.
