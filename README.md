# Intro to Molecular Simulations

## Overview
Welcome to the Intro to Molecular Simulations workshop!

In this workshop, 
This workshop will introduce molecular simulation, a powerful type of modeling with applications in many fields, including chemistry, biology, physics, medicine, and more. The theory behind two common forms of molecular modeling, molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC), will be reviewed, and we will use Python to set up, run, and analyze these two types of simulations. 
   
## Requirements
* Basic Python knowledge (syntax, file I/O)
* Access to Google Colab

<If a unix terminal is needed, include instructions to download it on windows>
We will be using the unix terminal to run our analyses. so be sure you have access to one. 
* Mac OS and any linux distribution will have a terminal already
    * Mac OS: search for terminal in your spotlight search
* Windows users: 
    * Option 1: Download a [unix subsystem (WSL)](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview) **recommended
    * Option 2: Download [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)
   
## Sofware <List of software that will be used during the workshop>
* Please ensure that you have a Google account to use Google Colab.
